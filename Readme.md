# Driver level key simulation.
## Implementation based on CTypes.
# 驱动级按键模拟。
## 基于ctypes实现。

> Compared to the [`Pydamo`](https://github.com/bode135/pydamo "jump to the pydamo project") scheme, the CTypes scheme does not support background emulation, but supports 64-bit Python.

> ctypes方案对比[`pydamo`](https://github.com/bode135/pydamo "jump to the pydamo project")方案，不支持后台模拟，但支持64位python。
